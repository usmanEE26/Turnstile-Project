# Turnstile-Project
This is a research based project that explores power generation using turnstile and doubly-fed induction generator based system.
This repository contains 3 files.
Two of the files are matlab codes and the third one is the simulink simulation file.
The files are named as "mechanical_simulation.m", "electrical_simulation.m", and "simulation.slx".
To run this, open "mechanical_simulation.m" and run the segment of the code ignoring the commented code.
This will create data for the simulink file. Next, open "simulation.slx" and simply run the simulation.
You would be able to see the active power waveform in Scope 14.
Log the data from this scope and store it as an array back to the workspace.
Now, open "electrical_simulation.m" and from the workspace open the "out" dataset and delete the entire first column of the variable that you logged the data in.
You can simply run this file now and see the average power generated for the mechanical speed profile you observed in "mechanical_simulation.m".
If you want to see the full mechanical modeling of the turnstile, uncomment the code under Simulation 1 heading in "mechanical_simulation" and repeat the procedure described above to find the average active power generated by the turnstile model.
